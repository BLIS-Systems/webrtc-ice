## WebRTC-ICE

This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow creation of
an RTCIceTransport interface in situations where audio and video is not
negotiated (e.g. data exchange only).  This specification is being developed
in conjunction with protocol specifications developed by the IETF ICE Working
Group.
